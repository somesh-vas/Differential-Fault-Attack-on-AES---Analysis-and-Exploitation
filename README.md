## Project Description

In this Project, you are tasked with implementing a Differential Fault Attack on AES. The goal is to recover the first column (first 32 bits) of the round 10 key using two pairs of faulty and correct ciphertext. 



**Correct Ciphertext1:** 0xcb9e460f86b40b7d3b9ec48a0726acef  
**Correct Ciphertext2:** 0xe38830724a96247185621d21458c16fb  
**Faulty Ciphertext1:** 0x7fb5bd33e30867882ad89d326d824dc9  
**Faulty Ciphertext2:** 0x48c3b33b3516a1f8c31d08f90479b7b5  

The attack targets faults introduced before the MixColumns operation of round 8, leading to a single-byte difference at the input of the 9th round MixColumns. The fault generates a 4-byte output difference which undergoes S-box and ShiftRow operations in the 10th round.

## Attack Logic

The attacker aims to recover the 4-byte difference `(f0, f1, f2, f3)` using the provided equations. The fault can occur at four different positions within the 4x4 difference matrix `S3` in the first column. The equations provide relationships between the fault-free ciphertext `C`, faulty ciphertext `C*`, and the round 10 key `K10`.

For example, for a fault at position `(0,0)` before Mix Column of Round 8, the equation involves operations using the Inverse Sub-box `S^-1`.

## Key Recovery

Using the derived equations and the given fault-free and faulty ciphertext pairs, the attacker calculates potential keys for the 10th round. The correct key should provide a 4-byte tuple that matches a predefined list `D`. The correct guess for keys `K10_0,0`, `K10_1,3`, `K10_2,2`, and `K10_3,2` should satisfy this condition.

## Implementation Results

After following the above steps, the calculated 128-bit 10th round key is:
**0xa3d05ade 4ff9266d 12b0e075 e8a4ebdd**

Hence, the first 32 bits of the 10th round key are:
**0xa3d05ade**

## Verification

To confirm the correctness of the 10th round key, a provided website [AES Step-by-Step](https://www.cryptool.org/en/cto/aes-step-by-step) can be used. This website allows you to validate the generated 10th round key using the provided Master Key.
